                    For this project, we were tasked with creating a poster to visually
                    communicate statistics on a social issue. We could only use graphs,
                    charts, and icons that we designed based on our research. For my
                    poster, I decided to base it on teen vaping awareness. The goal was
                    to grab the attention of a viewer&#39;s eye through our poster title and
                    design of icons, charts, and graphs.

                    This project consisted of selecting a tea company and creating a
                    new tea product. We stuck to a tea company&#39;s design elements and ethos. We came up with a target
                    audience and based our colors,
                    design, tea, and fonts on our audience. I decided to create a new
                    line of Stash-branded Eco-Cups, which are ecologically friendlier
                    versions of K-Cups. I created two flavors to reach the needs of my
                    target audience through its flavor, health benefits, and imagery.

                    on a nature trail that you typically wouldn&#39;t find in nature such
                    as a wooden fence. I went to many different trails in the Central
                    Illinois area, photographed, and edited the pictures.</p>

                    Lucille&#39;s sporadic typographic style, use of white backgrounds, and
                    use of yellow, I was able to imitate Lucille&#39;s style. I bound my book
                    through the technique of Japanese Stitch Binding using fabric from
                    the Philippines, Lucille&#39;s native country.</p>
