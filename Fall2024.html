                <p class="TennisPara">With this project, we researched the process of how an item is made
                    from scratch to how it ends up on a store shelf. We had to visualize
                    and make a poster based on these steps The goal of the project
                    was to only use icons (no words) to describe each step. I chose to
                    go with the process of a tennis ball as I played tennis in high school
                    and still enjoy the sport.</p>

                    class="CheesecakeIMG">
                <p class="CheesecakePara">For this project, we focused on text layout. We also were taught
                    about character and paragraph styles. Those two factors were
                    the main focus of this project. We had to find recipes to create
                    our cookbooks, layout the recipe&#39;s text in an appealing way, and
                    find appropriate imagery to go with the recipes. The project also
                    required a theme and color scheme. I stuck with a simple but
                    elegant theme with a grayish-blue pallet. I knew instantly I wanted
                    to make a cheesecake cookbook as it&#39;s my favorite dessert.</p>

                    make the book informative yet visually appealing. I based my book on Japan.</p>

                    illustrative design and infographics were needed to represent an
                    unbiased view of the data.</p>

                    stray away from
                    the basic pie chart. I chose the country of Japan because I watch
                    anime, and I also like to listen to Japanese music.</p>
